# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: Props are properties of a class object in React. They can be used when referencing a property from another component. 

  Researched answer: Props allow us to pass data from a class-based component to another component in React. Props can be passed from the parent to children components and props are keys of the objects. The props can be accessed with this.props.(props name) syntax. When using props, you can set its value to more than just strings, but also numbers, booleans, arrays, variables, and objects.



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: Document object model is what you see on the computer as a user. 

  Researched answer: DOM events are actions being done by the user and/or  by the computer. They can include click, resize, load, touch and others and are not limited to just place on the document. Events signal the occurence of something happening and can then be used in functions (onClick=). The mouse, keyboard strokes of a user can include DOM events like keydown, drag, click, doubleclick, drag, mouseover and more. 



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: Object-oriented programming refers to isolating and storing information separately while still being able to be accessed and used as needed in coding. Functional coding relies more on functions for code to run. 

  Researched answer: Objects in programming deal with data that have information like fields, attributes, and methods. These classes or objects can be easily reused code. Functional programming on the other hand, is more math-based programming that are composed of functions. Functional programming is thought to be less likely to have bugs due to the fact that with some given arguments, the return is consistent. Object-oriented programming allows for more dynamic behavior to include inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulaiton. 



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: A float is a decimal number while an integer is a whole number in Ruby. They are both distinctyly their own type of data and have to be specified in the code. 

  Researched answer: An integer is similar to a natural number starting from 1, 2, 3, 4, and so forth with the difference being an integer also goes in the negative direction  as well: -1, -2, -3, etc. A float in Ruby represents inexact real numbers and contains a decimal point. Float is different from decimal in that decimal is used for more precise decimal numbers. 



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: An implicit return means that without making specific instructions for how the code should return, it will automatically reference the last line of code. 

  Researched answer: Implicit return in Ruby means that the block of code will return the last line value without needing to include "return" whereas in Javascript without a return, it comes back undefined. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: Instance variable is defined in a class that can be used by other objects that have instantiated the class. Ruby instance variable has the @ symbol as opposed to JS's this. 

2. PostgreSQL: "Is an advanced version of SQL to provide support to different functions..." On Macs, it's the default db. 

3. Ruby on Rails: A server-side framework that allows database creation, migrations, and scaffoldig to assist in providing structure and build websites.

4. ORM: Object-rational mapping converts data between relational dbs and object-oriented programming languages. It helps with efficiency of development time. 

5. Active Record: Active Record is an ORM. It can create models using generate command.
